# iGEM Measurement Validator webservice


Developed by the iGEM Measurement Committee

## Installation notes

This webservice uses the TASBE Excel Validator as its backend.

- This package is written in octave, which needs to be installed in addition to the python requirements
- It can be obtained from https://github.com/TASBE/Excel_Process_Validator
- Follow the install instructions from that repository, which include installing various octave dependencies

If you are running on a very "bare metal" machine, such as a cloud container, you may need to install some usually pre-installed dependencies, such as unzip
